Prime: (Outputs the number followed by p if prime, else simply outputs the number)
"(1ƒ)?p
2%¿f" (11 bytes):
Main function:
        Implicit input
(       For each number less than the input
1ƒ      Call function 1 (returns false if the number is divisible by another number)
)       End loop
?       If the last value is true (if f1 never returned false and the input is not 0)
p       Push 'p' to the stack
        Implicit output

Function 1:
2       Require 2 arguments
%       Push the quotient of the two arguments
¿       If the last value is false (if the quotient is 0)
f       Push 'f' (false value) to the stack
        Implicit return

Note: The program can be golfed to 7 bytes as "(%¿f)?p". It was left at 12 bytes for readability.
