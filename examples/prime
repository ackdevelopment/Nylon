Prime: (Outputs the number followed by p if prime, else simply outputs the number)
"(1ƒ?p
2%¿f:" (11 bytes):
Main function:
        Implicit input
(       For each number less than the input
1ƒ      Call function 1 (returns false if the number is divisible by another number)
        Implicit end loop
?       If the last value is true (if f1 never returned false and the input is not 0)
p       Push 'p' to the stack
        Implicit output

Function 1:
2       Require 2 arguments
%       Push the quotent of the two arguments
¿       If the last value is false (if the quotient is 0)
f       Push 'f' (false value) to the stack
:       Return the last value of the stack

Note: The program can be golfed to 8 bytes as "(%¿f:)?p". It was left at 11 bytes for readability.
